# ml_universuty_project
logistic regression project for Machine Learning course

There was a dataset included information about appartment rent on Airbnb.
The ML model predicts if the host is superhost according to several parameters.

This is my first ML project so it's NOT a pet project. Its purpose is to watch sklearn's and other modules functionality.
